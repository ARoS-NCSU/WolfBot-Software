# Filename:     /etc/dhcp3/dhclient-exit-hooks.d/hostname
# Purpose:      Used by dhclient-script to set the hostname of the system
#               to match the DNS information for the host as provided by
#               DHCP.
# Depends:      dhcp3-client (should be in the base install)
#               hostname (for hostname, again, should be in the base)
#               bind9-host (for host)
#               coreutils (for cut and echo)
